This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to building HTTP APIs using Go (Golang). The goal is to understand how Go handles HTTP requests and returns structured data in JSON format by creating a simple, functional API server.

##What This Project Covers

Setting up a basic HTTP server in Go

Using structs to represent data

Encoding and returning JSON responses

Testing API endpoints in a browser

##Why This Project

This project focuses on learning Go fundamentals the traditional way—without frameworks—so that core concepts like request handling, data structures, and JSON encoding are clearly understood before moving on to more advanced tools.

##Status

🚧 **In Progress** – This project is being built step by step as part of a Go learning journey.
